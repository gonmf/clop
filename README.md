Fork of RÃ©mi Coulom's CLOP (v0.0.9) aimed for LTS

For more information read: http://www.remi-coulom.fr/CLOP/

This project hopes to contain a fork of CLOP: Confident Local Optimization for Noisy Black-Box Parameter Tuning, aimed at:

1. Bug fixing.
2. Simplifying the most important parts of CLOP (from a user point of view) to ensure it can be used in the future. It currently depends on many system assumptions and conventions.

This project is not affilliated with the original work on CLOP.
